TicketDesk
==========
TicketDesk is an issue tracking system for IT Help Desks.

TicketDesk is efficient and designed to do only one thing, facilitate communications between help desk staff and end users. The overriding design goal is to be as simple and frictionless for both users and help desk staff as is possible.
